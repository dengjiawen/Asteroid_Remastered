 * Revision History (Release 1.0)
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERSION     AUTHOR/      DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE
 * OLD/NEW     DATE
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * --/0.1  | J.D.          | Initial creation of program
 *         | 25-05-17      |
 *---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------
 * 0.1/0.2 | J.D.          | Offloaded string en/decrypt functionality into
 *         | 29-05-17      | generalized & encapsulated methods.
 *---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------
 * 0.2/0.3 | J.D.          | Modified SaveProcessor class so that all methods
 *         | 31-05-17      | now take URL as parameters instead of File.
 *---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------
 * 0.3/0.4 | J.D.          | Added SaveManager class to manage FTP file
 *         | 02-06-17      | uploading.
 *---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------
 * 0.4/1.0 | J.D.          | Major update: added activation feature, and
 *         | 02-06-17      | first time setup methods.
 *---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This is a piece of custom code with a custom algorithm for encrypting and
 * decrypting strings. By shifting every single character in the string by one
 * unit (Example: a -> b, H -> I, 1 -> 2), this algorithm effectively renders
 * game save files unreadable/meaningless.
 *
 * This class also contain various methods for uploading & encrypting,
 * downloading & decrypting save files for the game, as well as activation
 * and first time setup methods for new players.
 *
 * The save file contains the player's top score.
 *
