# Kill_Everyone
A modern take on the decade old game "Asteroid"..
This is the result of over 1 week of development,
and tens of minutes of manpower.
It will be constantly improved upon with new features and GUI.

# HUD (May 6, 2017)
The HUD function for the game had been partially activated.
HUD elements on the left hand side of the game is now visible.
However, the left-side HUD is only for cosmetic purposes.
Functional HUD will arrive in future updates.

# BASIC CONTROLS
Arrow Keys: Up, Down, Left, Right
Left Click: Shoot

I do not recommand changing the keyboard configurations.
Switching to WSAD will cause runtime errors.
